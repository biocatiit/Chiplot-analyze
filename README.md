# Chiplot-analyze
Chiplot-analyze is a utility program designed to take as input 1D traces of the integrated intensity along rectangular boxed shaped regions aligned along either the equator, the meridian, or along a layer line using the program  FIT2D (http://www.esrf.eu/computing/scientific/FIT2D/ [www.esrf.eu] ) and saved as “chiplot” files.  Chiplot files are an ASCIII format and are easily readable in various ways. What chiplot-analyze does is take one of these traces and splits into two halves containing symmetrical diffraction patterns from the left or right (if trace is from the equator or a layer line) or top and bottom (if trace is along the meridian). You can then subtract a continuous background for the trace  using a convex hull algorithm and save the background subtracted trace in a new file.  The background subtracted trace can then be input into various peak fitting programs for further analysis. In the Irving lab this is usually the Fityk program (http://fityk.nieto.pl/ [fityk.nieto.pl]) which allows defining custom peak functions. The final thing chiplot-analyze can do is to calculate  the centroid and integrated of  user defined diffraction peaks and save the results to a file. The functionality of chiplot-analyze has been incorporated into the MuscleX package (https://github.com/biocatiit/musclex/wiki [github.com]) which is a recommended replacement for chiplot-analyze.  It is provided as a legacy application for someone wishing to replicate earlier published work.
